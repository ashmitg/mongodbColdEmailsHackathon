# Cold Emailing Tool with MongoDB Atlas Vector Search

## Overview

This tool leverages Next.js for frontend development, MongoDB Atlas for vector search capabilities, and integrates GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) for composing personalized cold emails. It includes features for scraping website information and utilizes a RAG (Retrieve, Analyze, Generate) pipeline.
